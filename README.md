# C_Shell_OSN
The objective of this mini-project is to build a custom shell in C, mimicking the behavior of popular shells like Bash. A shell serves as an interface between the user and the operating system, enabling command execution, process management, and system interaction. Through this project, the aim is to gain hands-on experience with core system programming concepts, such as system calls, process handling, and modular code design.

**Progress-**
Working on basic system calls-
Specification 1 : Display Requirement
Specification 2 : Input Requirements (use of ‘strtok’ to tokenize the input)
Specification 3 : hop (‘hop’ command changes the directory that the shell is currently in)
Specification 4 : reveal (‘reveal’ command lists all the files and directories in the specified directories in lexicographic order)
Specification 5 : log commands
