# C_Shell_OSN

The objective of this mini-project is to build a custom shell in C, mimicking the behavior of popular shells like Bash. A shell serves as an interface between the user and the operating system, enabling command execution, process management, and system interaction. Through this project, the aim is to gain hands-on experience with core system programming concepts, such as system calls, process handling, and modular code design.

## Progress

Working on basic system calls:

- **Specification 1**: Display Requirement  
  Ensures appropriate prompts and feedback for user interaction.

- **Specification 2**: Input Requirements  
  Implements the use of `strtok` to tokenize the input for parsing commands.

- **Specification 3**: `hop` Command  
  Custom command to change the directory that the shell is currently in, similar to `cd`.

- **Specification 4**: `reveal` Command  
  Lists all files and directories in the specified directory or directories in lexicographic order.

- **Specification 5**: Command Logging  
  Logs all commands executed in the shell for tracking and debugging purposes.
